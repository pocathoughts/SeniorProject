## Tips
If shit hits the fan try .podspec file for inconsistencies

# When loading in a new phone gap project
You have to load in the folder in your project that contains the config.xml file
If you created the project with Pods:
This file is usually in Pods -> phonegap-ios-template (or android equivalent) -> Resources 
If you created the project without Pods:
You can find it in the main project folder, should be in the root.

## PhoneGap utilizes something called CocoaPods, for more insight look here
